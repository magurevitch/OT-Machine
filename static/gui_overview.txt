This machine uses a simplified version of Optimality Theory for Phonology.

The machine has two parts: one to specify your langauge's specifications, and one to use the langauge to generate surface forms.

When you are happy with your conlang, press "run the machine with the current conlang"

The two fields that cannot be null are the "vowels" and the "default syllable"

When you hover over a section of the language, it will expand to show all the options.

When you click on the label of a section, it will keep that section open even after you go to a different section.

Categories:
For each entry you put in, put your single-character category label in the first column, and comma-or-space separated phones of that category in the second column. All phonemes must be single characters.

Order:
The order is where you decide what constraints are more or less bad in your conlang. Select a constrain and use the arrow buttons to re√∂rder it. The top are the worst violations, and the bottom are the least bad.

The six violations are: "bs- having a Bad String," "chg- CHanGing a sound," "del- DELeting a sound," "harm - violating a HARMony or assimilation," "ins - INSerting a sound," and "pen- having a phonotactics violation PENalty"
