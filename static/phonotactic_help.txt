Phonotactics:
These fields are what syllables and the order of syllables look like.

Side:
This menu is to decide what side the stress is determined from. If all syllables have the same structure, you don't need to specify the side. If you want stressed syllables to look different, then choose which side it determines stress from.

Primary stress placement:
Where in the word the primary stress goes (1 = first syllable on the chosen side)

Syllables between stresses:
If you have no secondary stress in your language, put 0. Otherwise, number of unstressed syllables between stresses.

Can insert:
If checked, your language can insert an unstressed syllable, for a penalty. This allows for variable numbers of unstressed syllables between secondary stresses or for placement.

Can delete:
If checked, your language can delete an unstressed syllable, for a penalty.

Syllable structures:
If you are choosing between things, put them in brackets or the appropriate parenthases. Square brackets are neutrally decide between them. The choices should be separated by a pipe,slash, or backslash

Things in parenthases are optional, and in curly braces, {}, optional, but you get a penalty for not having any of the options inside.

A * before a symbol means that it is optional, but there is a penalty if you have it.

A # before a symbol means that there is a penalty if you choose the next symbol

If you don't put anything for a category, it defaults to the phonotactics of the next best possible thing (e.g. primary stress in secondary stressed syllables)
