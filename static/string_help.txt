A langauge's simple fields are as following:

Vowels:
Where you put the categories or sounds, comma-or-space separated, that are vowels. This is to make sure every syllable has a vowel, and allows you to specify changes that only occur in codas.

Undeletables:
Put sounds or categories of sounds that cannot be deleted, comma-or-space separated, in the undeletables section.

Geminates:
For sounds or categories that can be geminated.

Bad Strings
Bad strings is where you insert, as sounds, never with any categories, what sequences of sounds are bad in your language.
