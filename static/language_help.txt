Properties of languages that are outside of the phonology:

Conjugations:
In the conjugations table, you can add in each conjugation.

The from name can be something like "nominative" and the form should leave an underscore for each place the root appears (so reduplication with a t in the middle is _t_)

Orthographies:
You can specify an orthography, to allow for digraphs, easier typing, etc.
